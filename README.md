# Bikes

This assignment asks you to build a simple but realistic website for “Drexel Bikes”, a  fictitious organization (derived from Drexel Bike Share) in which a student can view a  catalog of bikes and rent a bike. The assignment allows you to practice several aspects of full-stack web development, including front-end coding using HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, and back-end coding using Flask and Python.


Home Page

create the home page’s main content area as a Bootstrap jumbotron. The page displays a jumbotron with the title “Drexel Bikes”, the subtext “Love bikes? We’re here for you!”, a main image, and two buttons (“Learn about us” which links to the “About” page, and “See our bikes” which links to the “Our Bikes” page).

“Our Bikes” Page

This page uses Flask templates and dynamic data to populate its contents. First, create a table using Bootstrap’s table class with a header row containing the header cells (“Image”, “Name”, etc.) and use Flask’s template system to generate the body HTML from data.
