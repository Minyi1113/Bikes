This assignment asks you to build a simple but realistic website for “Drexel Bikes”, a  fictitious organization (derived from Drexel Bike Share) in which a student can view a  catalog of bikes and rent a bike. The assignment allows you to practice several aspects of full-stack web development, including front-end coding using HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, and back-end coding using Flask and Python.
